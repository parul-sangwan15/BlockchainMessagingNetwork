<b>Client-server interaction and peer-to-peer interactions</b>
<br>
Cancel culture, also known as call-out culture, is a modern term for ostracism in which 
someone is pushed out of social or professional circles, whether online, on social media, or in 
person. It is said that those who have been subjected to this ostracism have been "cancelled."
For many teenagers, being cancelled is the harshest punishment imaginable because rejection 
by their peers is their greatest fear. As a result, there is a connection between cancel culture 
and mental health.
<br>
With this project we are looking to contribute to the global problem that is Cancel Culture 
and Free Speech. In order to help combat this problem we are looking to build a network of 
nodes that can be used to communicate and publish to a public message board where all 
messages are stored forever.
<br>

Networking aspects of our Solution: -
* Our application is based on client-server interaction and peer-to-peer interactions.
* We can set up multiple nodes by using multiple terminals.
* This project was inspired by: -
    * Blockchain
    * Blockchain basics
    * Python Blockchain App
<br>
It was inspired by this repo in particular, from which I modified the web app 
interface. Much larger changes were made to the blockchain code, which we 
refactored quite a bit to produce cleaner and more modular code - this really helped 
with our understanding of blockchain. I also refactored the networking code to suit 
our needs, and once again, make it ‘cleaner’ and more readable.
